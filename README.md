# Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application

## Project Overview

The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. By streamlining data collection and providing powerful tools for data-driven decision-making, this project can significantly improve operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

## Business Use Cases

This project can be applied in various scenarios, including:

1. **Travel Aggregators**: Offer real-time bus schedules and seat availability to customers.
2. **Market Analysis**: Study travel trends and preferences for market research.
3. **Customer Service**: Enhance user experience by providing tailored travel options based on data insights.
4. **Competitor Analysis**: Evaluate pricing and service levels against competitors.

## Approach

### Data Scraping

Leverage Selenium to automate the extraction of data from Redbus, capturing details such as:
- **Bus Routes**
- **Bus Route Links**
- **Bus Types**
- **Prices**
- **Seat Availability**
- **Departure Times**
- **Durations**
- **Bus Ratings**

### Streamlit Application

Develop a Streamlit application for displaying and filtering the data. Include filters such as:
- **State**
- **Route**
- **Seat Type**
- **Seat Rating**
- **Bus Starting Time**
- **Price**
  
### Data Analysis/Filtering

- Utilize SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.
- Enable users to interact with and explore data through the Streamlit interface.

## Results

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

1. Successfully scrape data for at least 10 state-run bus transport services from the Redbus website, along with private bus information for selected routes.
2. Store the extracted data in a structured SQL database.
3. Develop a responsive and user-friendly Streamlit application for data filtering and visualization.

## Data Storage

Store the collected data in a well-organized SQL database to ensure efficient querying and management.
