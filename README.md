Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application

Project Overview

The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" project aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by automating the collection, analysis, and visualization of bus travel data. This solution uses Selenium for web scraping to gather comprehensive information from Redbus, such as bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The extracted data is stored in a SQL database and made accessible through an intuitive Streamlit application for interactive filtering and analysis.

Business Use Cases

This project can be applied in various scenarios, including:

Travel Aggregators: Offer real-time bus schedules and seat availability to customers.

Market Analysis: Study travel trends and preferences for market research.

Customer Service: Enhance user experience by providing tailored travel options based on data insights.

Competitor Analysis: Evaluate pricing and service levels against competitors.

Approach

Data Scraping

Leverage Selenium to automate the extraction of data from Redbus, capturing details such as:

Bus Routes

Bus Route Links

Bus Types

Fares (Prices)

Seat Availability

Departure Times

Trip Durations

Bus Ratings

Streamlit Application

Develop a Streamlit application for displaying and filtering the data. Include filters such as:

Bus Routes

Bus Route Links

Bus Types

Fares (Prices)

Seat Availability

Departure Times

Trip Durations

Bus Ratings

Data Analysis/Filtering

Utilize SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.

Enable users to interact with and explore data through the Streamlit interface.

Results

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

Successfully scrape data for at least 10 state-run bus transport services from the Redbus website, along with private bus information for selected routes.

Store the extracted data in a structured SQL database.

Develop a responsive and user-friendly Streamlit application for data filtering and visualization.

Data Storage

Store the collected data in a well-organized SQL database to ensure efficient querying and management.
